    "My goal was never to change the world with my capstone, not or even to put together a novel analysis or model. All I wanted was to build a rock solid set of specialized skills in computer vision. The objective of the computer vision field is to program computers to gain human-level insight from images and videos. To familiarize myself with the field, I set out to replicate and understand state of the art neural network models on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark. The task leaves little room for innovation; human level accuracy has already been surpassed, which is fine. The project was ideal to boost me to the forefront of research. "

    "Data scientists never stop whining about how the majority of their time is spent collecting data, extracting data, cleaning data, munging data, aka \"eating shit\", with only a sliver of time left for juicy modeling. Well, not in my case. I chose to work with a popular premade dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 tiny (32 x 32) images in ten different class categories. Classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. More information on the CIFAR image datasets can be found at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.\n",

    "My goal was to build a model than can classify the CIFAR-10 as well as a human. Up until a few years ago, achieving human-level accuracy on perceptual tasks was a fool's errand. For good reason. Image classification is tough. Images of cars vary in infinite ways. A car is still a car regardless of lighting, orientation, blur, or any other low-level visual feature. Most machine learning algorithms are hopeless at picking out the invariance of object categories."
